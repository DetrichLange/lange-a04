Create a program that generates a website skeleton with the following specifications:
Prompt for the name of the site.
Prompt for the author of the site.
Ask if the user wants a folder for JavaScript files.
Ask if the user wants a folder for CSS files.
Generate an index.html file that contains the name of the site inside the <title> tag and the author in a <meta> tag.
The user should then find these files and directories created in the working directory of your program.
